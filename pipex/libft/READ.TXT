Makefile:

make all: compile and link all the files including all the bonus files.
make bonus: compile and link all the files including all the bonus files, 
			NOT ONLY bonus files, same as 'make all'.

touch ft_atoi.c (basic) ->
make: only recompile the file ft_atoi.c, then ar rc into the updated library.
		No problem of relink.

touch get_next_line_bonus.c (bonus) ->
make: only recompile the file get_next_line_bonus.c, then ar rc into the updated 
		library, same as "touch ft_atoi.c (basic)".

touch libft.h(ft_printf.h / get_next_line.h / get_next_line_bonus.h)
make: recompile all the source files including bonus files. (make all is the default
		whether 'make' or 'make all' is used.)


Makefile1:

make all: only compile and link all the basic files. NOT including all the bonus 
			files.
make bonus: only compile and link all the bonus files, different from 'make all'.

touch ft_atoi.c (basic) ->
make: only recompile the file ft_atoi.c, then ar rc into the updated library.
        No problem of relink.

After 'make bonus', then 'touch get_next_line_bonus.c (bonus)' ->
make: recompile nothing, because make all is the default when make is used.

touch libft.h(ft_printf.h / get_next_line.h / get_next_line_bonus.h) ->
make: only recompile all the basic source files, NOT including bonus files.

After 'make bonus', then 'touch get_next_line_bonus.c (bonus)' ->
make bonus: only recompile get_next_line_bonus.c (bonus). No problem of relink.
